## ðŸŒŸ Features

- *Decentralized Profiles*  
  Users can create and manage their profiles on-chain by staking a small amount of ALGO, ensuring data ownership and deterring spam.

- *Reputation System*  
  An on-chain reputation score is updated with each meaningful interaction, creating a transparent and self-regulating community.

- *Secure Messaging*  
  Users can send paid messages to each other, with payments handled by the smart contract via inner transactions, ensuring trustless and efficient transfers.

- *Non-Custodial*  
  The smart contract is non-custodial. User-staked funds are held by the contract but can be retrieved when the user opts out, ensuring full control of assets.

- *Immutable Logic*  
  Built with *PyTeal*, the smart contract logic is immutable and transparent, providing a high degree of trust in the applicationâ€™s rules.
